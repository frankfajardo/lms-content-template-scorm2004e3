                <p>It is important that you understand your site's emergency procedures and know the location of the evacuation assembly points. Assembly points will vary from different locations within a building and from site to site. It is therefore important to familiarise yourself with all emergency procedures relating to your building and prior to visiting any other site.</p>
                <p>In the event of a bomb threat or the assembly point is unsafe, the Chief Warden may advise of an alternative assembly point. Information on the various site specific details can be found on NEO.</p>
