                <p>In various Pearson Australia Group locations, mechanisms have been put in place to ensure appropriate consultation with employees. These may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a designated Health and Safety Representative (HSR) who has been elected, or</li>
                    <li>you may have an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) committee established, or</li>
                    <li>regular OHS meetings with your smaller sites and teams.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The HSR and the OHS committees may also be called upon to discuss and resolve workplace OHS issues. Employees should first try to resolve any OHS issues with their manager. If the issue is not resolved, they should discuss it with their HSR or a member of their OHS committee.</p>
