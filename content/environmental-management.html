                <p>As part of our ISO14001 accreditation and our overall commitment to the environment, we aim to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduce our consumption of energy, water and other material resources</li>
                    <li>reduce and control pollution and emissions</li>
                    <li>manage waste generated from our business operations</li>
                    <li>encourage employees to become actively involved in environmental matters</li>
                    <li>monitor and audit environmental performance in order to achieve continuous improvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our initiatives are developed and implemented by the Environmental Management Review team and Pearson&apos;s Green Champions from across the business.</p>
                <p>We all retain a degree of responsibility for ensuring protection of environmental values and meeting our environmental targets. In order to discharge our legal obligations under PAG&apos;s environmental management system, employees must take all reasonable steps to protect the environment.</p>
