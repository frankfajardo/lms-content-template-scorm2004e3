                <p>In the event of injury or illness, Pearson Australia will ensure that the necessary assistance is available for the employee to remain at work, or return to work as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>A Return To Work (RTW) plan will be prepared in consultation with the employee, their manager and the treating medical practitioner. The employee must provide their manager and RTW coordinator with the appropriate workers compensation medical certificate issued by the treating medical practitioner. Every effort will be made to provide suitable employment including modified, graduated and/or alternative duties.</p>
                <p>The RTW Coordinator (or HR Manager) will work with you to provide return to work support.</p>
